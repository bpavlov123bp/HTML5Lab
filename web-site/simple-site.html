            <p>HTML 5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web.
            It is the fifth and current version of the HTML standart.</p>
            <p>It was published in October 2014 by the World Wide Web Consorcium (W3C) to improvethe language with
            support for the latest multimedia, while keeping it easily readable by humans and consistently
            understood by computers and devices such as web browsers, parsres, ect. HTML 5 is intended to subsume
            not only HTML4, but also XHTML 1, DOM Level 2 HTML.</p>
            <p>HTML 5 includes detailed processing models to encourage more interoperable implementation;
            it extends, improves and rationalizes the markup available for documents, and introduces markup and
            application programming interfaces(APIs) for complex web application. [5] For the same reason , HTML 5
            is also candidate for cross-platform mobile applications, because it includes features designed with
            low-powered devices such as smartphones and tablets.</p>
